## Getting Started 🚀

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites 📋

- Node.js
- PostgreSQL
- Docker (if setting up PostgreSQL via Docker)

### Installation 📦

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
cd yourrepository
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:

```env
AUTH_SECRET=your_own_secret
DB_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/dbname
```

You need to define your own `AUTH_SECRET` and `DB_URL`.

To set up a PostgreSQL container using Docker, run the following command (requires Docker to be installed):

```bash
docker run --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -e POSTGRES_USER=username -e POSTGRES_DB=dbname -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```

In that case, the `DB_URL` would be:

```env
DB_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/dbname
```

4. Run database migrations:

```bash
npx drizzle-kit up
```

5. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
